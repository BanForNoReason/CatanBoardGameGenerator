- For 5-6 players, 5 brick tiles, 5 rock tiles, 6 wood tiles, 6 sheep tiles, 6 wheat tiles, 2 desert tiles
- 1 of each port, 2 sheep port, and the rest are 3 for 1
- I guess refer to pictures for the amount of each number

  - Balancing options:
  - can the red numbers be next to each other?
  - Can the same resource be next to each other (optional, input maximum number of the same resources that can touch each other. Example: if you enter 3 for this option it means that a maximum of 3 of the same tiles can touch each other.
